# Growautomation
We want to make an easy solution for anybody to automate everything around growing plants.
Making it easier and optimizing the process.

And provide code samples to the diy community.


## Currently active projects
- writing installation manual / scripting installation
- implementing systemd timers to replace cronjobs
- implementing log-level
- updating sensor code to use functions and be more scalable without human interaction
- centralizing the configuration and implementing the config change into the setup script


## Planned projects
- webserver for observation and manual actions
- implementation of an air speed sensor
- implementation of 3d-printable window openers (with dc motors)
- troubleshooing script to gather bug logs
- checking clean solutions to implement analog sensors on the raspberry pi (p.e. ADS1115)
