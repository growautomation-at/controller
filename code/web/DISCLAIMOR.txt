### DISCLAIMOR ###

I have little experience with the django framework, the mvc software design and web-development itself.

This webinterface is currently NOT:
* object-oriented
  * and therefore not optimized to use as little code as possible
* secure
  * I used the basic security config and some common sense -> nothing special
* using good html/css/js
