Description
***********

Here we will go through what we recommend to buy for a GrowAutomation project setup.

The access to your/a network (*LAN/WLAN/..*) and power will not be included in this guide. You can check out the :ref:`connect guide <setup-connect>` for that.

We will show you three sets of setups:

* A **recommended** setup
* A **medium** budget setup
* And a cheaper **low** budget setup

Low
***

This setup **IS NOT RECOMMENDED for beginners**!

It will require you to do **more and complexer tasks** to set it up.

In the **future** we might develop a **server-agent setup** (*Ticket #39*) which would allow you to use cheaper agent-hardware than a raspberry.
This will lower the cost of a single setup.

Price
=====

Like mentioned in the intro above => you WILL find the listed products for a lower price on other platforms than amazon!

**Full price point**:

between (*around*) 90€ and 110€


Raspberry
=========

**Price point**: around 35€

* `Raspberry 3 A+ <https://www.amazon.de/Raspberry-Mainboard-Cortex-1-4GHZ-11811853/dp/B07KKBCXLY>`_
* `SD Card <https://www.amazon.de/SanDisk-microSDHC-memory-adapter-performance/dp/B08GY9NYRM>`_
* As a power supply use a smartphone power supply => but check that it has AT LEAST a rating for 1,5A; else your raspberry might crash randomly
* No case at all

Power
=====

**Price point**: -

* 3V, 5V => just use the raspberry DC output
* 12V => get some old unused 12V DC power supply; else but the one listed in the 'medium' section

Cabling
=======

**Price point**: around 30€

* **Basic**

  * `Electric tape <https://www.amazon.de/T1510-Temflex-Electrical-Insulation-7000062272/dp/B002Z7WW48>`_

* **Internal** (*interconnections inside the cabinet*)

  * `jumper wires <https://www.amazon.de/AZDelivery-Jumper-Arduino-Raspberry-Breadboard/dp/B074P726ZR>`_

    * Instead of using a gpio breakout => you could use jumper wires to connect the gpio's directly to the breadboards
    * Instead of breadboard wires you could just use jumper wire

  * You can just use some left-over network cabling for internal wiring
  * `Breadboards <https://www.amazon.de/AZDelivery-Mini-Breadboard-400-Pin-Parent/dp/B07VFK5CRP>`_
  * `Wire screw connectors <https://www.amazon.de/Aihasd-Terminal-Circuit-Connector-Printkl/dp/B00VGGFPZW>`_
  * Else you can use any other cable with around 0.2mm² conductor thickness

* **External** (*connections to the sensors and actors*)

  * `Network cable <https://www.amazon.de/LogiLink-Installation-Cable-S-FTP-CPV0030/dp/B002BEN9E2>`_
  * If you don't want to use splitters => just wire each sensor directly

Cabinet
=======

**Price point**: around 25-45€

* As a cabinet for the installation you could use an electrical cabinet or just a wooden box

  Then you need to:

    * mount everything inside with hot glue or something like that
    * cut-out openings for wires and so on

  Is more work; but it can be nice. But it will unlikely be.

  * `IP65 plastic box <https://www.amazon.de/Junction-weatherproof-adaptable-enclosure-outdoor/dp/B00U6BUE4U>`_
  * `Wooden box <https://www.amazon.de/Zeller-13151-Purpose-Cover-Softwood/dp/B003ESGFNQ>`_


* If you don't want to use any centralised cable management => you can just connect the network cables directly to your breadboards
* Else you can use a keystone panel:

  * `Keystone Jack <https://www.amazon.de/DIGITUS-CAT-5e-KEYSTONE-Keystone-termination/dp/B001E3HYDS>`_
  * `Keystone Enclosure <https://www.amazon.de/Goobay-Keystone-Empty-Enclosure-White/dp/B0797L5J2J>`_

* `Power strip <https://www.amazon.de/Brennenstuhl-Eco-Line-Safety-Switch-1159500015/dp/B002N6ZEFA>`_ (*if you don't have one laying around*)
