Basic raspberry pi setup on ssd

What to buy: 
(only for rpi setup)
1. Raspberry Pi
2. A 2,5" ssd with around 120gb should be enough
3. A usb to sata chassis for 2,5" disks
4. RPI heat sinks
5. RPI 5V mini-fan for cooling
  When using an usb-ssd you should consider cooling your rpi with a fan since it consumes more power than normally.
  The most heat will be produced in the area where the micro-usb cable for power-supply gots plugged in.
