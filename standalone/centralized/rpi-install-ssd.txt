Basic raspberry pi setup on ssd

What to buy:
1. A 2,5" ssd with around 120gb should be enough
2. A usb to sata chassis for 2,5" disks
3. RPI heat sinks
4. RPI 5V mini-fan for cooling
  When using an usb-ssd you should consider cooling your rpi with a fan since it consumes more power than normally.
  The most heat will be produced in the area where the micro-usb cable for power-supply gots plugged in.
